## Finding Map Features

Open the Feature Navigation windows to see the list of available features. After clickng on a feature in the table, the map will pan to the feature and display additional context information about the feature. For example, when we click on the "Fantom 3" group in the "Players", we get a popup with additional data. If we then click on one of the waypoints, the map will pan to that waypoint:
