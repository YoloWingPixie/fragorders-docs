<b>Q:</b> What is Frag Orders?

<b>A:</b> Frag Orders is a visualization and mission planning tool for DCS World that focuses on planning multiplayer missions.

<b>Q:</b> How does Frag Orders work?

<b>A:</b>  When a mission creator uploads their DCS World .miz file, Frag Orders parses the file and extracts the relevant data for the Frag Order visualization. This data is saved on the Frag Orders server. Once the Frag Order is published, a public URL is created that can be distributed to mission participants.

<b>Q:</b> As the mission creator, can I control which items appear on the Frag Order map?

<b>A:</b> Yes, the mission creator can choose which data is publish to the public Frag Order. For example, it is possible to hide enemy groups to provide a more dynamic experience for mission participants. Groups marked as "hidden" in the DCS World mission editor are hidden in the Frag Order map by default.
