It's time to go live! Our closed alpha period is coming to an end and will be replaced by an Open Beta program. Here are the highlights and what to expect in 2024:

## Subscription Portal is live!

Our subscription portal has been turned on and is ready for use! Anyone who wishes to sign up for Frag Orders Premium will now be able to begin a 14 day trial. After the 14 days, users will be able to submit a payment method to continue their subscription for $5 a month. Check out the [User Settings](https://fragorders.com/settings) page for more information.

## Closed Alpha Premium Access

During our (long) Closed Alpha phase, lots of users have been granted closed alpha subscriptions by Frag Orders admins. To complete the Closed Alpha phase, these subscriptions will be disabled, and users will need to sign up for Frag Orders Premium via the User Settings page. **All Closed Alpha subscriptions will be disabled on Monday February, 5th 2024**. 
If you would like to sign up for Premium before the end of the Alpha period (and support the development of Frag Orders), you can subscribe via the User Settings page at any time.

## Soft launch goals

We have a couple of goals for our soft-launch period:

1. Ensure that the subscription user-experience is easy and usable. 
2. Test our backend billing automation systems are working correctly
3. Establish a subscriber base to drive feature development for the year

Once we are confident that these goals have been met, we will host a launch event for subscribers that will hopefully drive more people to Frag Orders.

Stay tuned!
