It's time to go live! Our closed alpha period is coming to an end and will be replaced by an Open Beta program. Here are the highlights and what to expect in 2024:


## Subscription Portal is live

Our subscription portal has been turned on and is ready for use! Anyone who wishes to sign up for Frag Orders Premium will now be able to begin a 14 day trial. After the 14 days, users will be able to submit a payment method to continue their subscription for $5 a month. Check out the [User Settings](https://fragorders.com/settings) page for more information.


## Closed Alpha Premium Access

During our (long) Closed Alpha phase, lots of users have been granted closed alpha subscriptions by Frag Orders admins. To complete the Closed Alpha phase, these subscriptions will be disabled, and users will need to sign up for Frag Orders Premium via the User Settings page. **All Closed Alpha subscriptions will be disabled on Monday February, 5th 2024**
