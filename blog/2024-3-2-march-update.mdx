### Navigation Target Point Planning

It is now possible to for planners to add Navigation Target Points to via Frag Orders. 
This should help extend the capability of planners for certain modules, including the F-15E, F-14, JF-17 and more.[ Read more about it in the docs](/docs/planning-a-flight#adding-and-editing-navigation-target-points)

### Planning Rule UI Improvements

A major rework of the planning rule input has been launched! Mission creators will now be presented with a more intuitive UI that can handle missions with many groups. In addition, it is now possible to edit a planning rule (rather than having to delete and recreate every time). The docs have been updated to reflect this new UI.

### Large .miz file support

A new storage backend has been deployed to remove the previous limit on .miz file size for publishing Frag Orders. This change will only apply to newly created Frag Orders, while old Frag Orders will still use the legacy storage backend. Upload your most complex .miz file and try it out!
