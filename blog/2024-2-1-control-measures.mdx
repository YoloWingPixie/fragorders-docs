title: Major Feature Update - Control Measures

We have launched the initial version of the user-requested Control Measures features. Control Measures allow for mission participants to draw various shapes on the Frag Order map canvas. 
This will hopefully allow for new ways to collaboratively plan a mission, and is especially good for any human controllers that might be participating in missions via third-party software, like LotATC.

## Future Development

Here are some future functionality goals for the Control Measures features. Some of these will appear in the short term, while others will take a bit longer to implement:

* Export control measures from Frag Orders to LotATC as a .json file
* Save control measures into the .miz file as Drawing Objects so they appear on the F10 map in game
* Input control measures into aircraft avionics (once that feature is availabe in DCS!)
